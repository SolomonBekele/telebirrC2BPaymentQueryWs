#TO-BE Logical Architecture 
The Individual Customer Bill Payment feature allows an individual customer to pay bills to 
organizations through the Mobile Money system. Typical applications include paying water bill. An 
individual customer can initiate a bill payment transaction using the Mobile Money system on the 
handset instead of visiting customer service center of the bill issuer to pay bills. Here the bill issuer 
must have an account in telebirr. When the customer pays the bill, the paid amount is deducted from 
customers telebirr account to biller telebirr account
